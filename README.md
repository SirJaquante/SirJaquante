- 👋 Hi, I’m @SirJaquante
- 👀 I am a coder (I also fish...Alot.)
- 🌱 I do coder things like eat (sometimes.)
- 💞️ I code with people (online. I haven't seen a real person in years...)
- 📫 I like coding (it gets my mind off the fact that I haven't eaten in 3 weeks.)
- 😄 I think coding is hard (especially when sharks keep doing death circles around you...)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am in the middle of the ocean!
- 💀 Stop by my office (small raft) and say hi sometime!
- 🤢 Oh no! I'm getting sea sick!
- 🤮 I'd better stop before I... crap. now I have a puke filled boat. Gross.
- 😸 Anyway, maybe sometime you can stop by and get me something to eat! (please not fish!)
- 🆘 You can probably find me with my nightly S.O.S. flare!
- 👋 Hope to see you (or anyone) soon! bye!
- Uh oh the sharks are doing circles again.
